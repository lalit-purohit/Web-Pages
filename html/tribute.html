        <h3 id='title'>Here's a time line of Bhagat Singh's life:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><b>1907</b> - Born	27 September 1907[1]
Banga, Lyallpur District, Punjab Province, British India</li>
       <li><b>1923</b> - Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.[17] In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.</li>
       <li><b>1927</b> - Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. </li>
       <li><b>1928</b> - In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership,[b] and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it.</li>
       <li><b>1929</b> - In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims.[20] Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris,[35] Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly.</li>
       <li><b>1930</b> - The ordinance (and the tribunal) would lapse on 31 October 1930 as it had not been passed by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament. On 7 October 1930, the tribunal delivered its 300-page judgement based on all the evidence and concluded that the participation of Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru in Saunder's murder was proven. They were sentenced to death by hanging.</li>
       <li><b>1931</b> - Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931.[69] The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm[70] in the Lahore jail.</li>
     </ul>
